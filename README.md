# Running Concourse locally via Vagrant

This project is the result of quite a bit of experimentation trying to
get Concourse running locally on a Windows PC, to support some hobby
projects I wanted to work on. Presumably this would also work on other
platforms that support a VirtualBox provider, although its considerably
easier to get Concourse working on Mac OS X and Linux just by using
Docker directly.

## TL;DR

1. Set the environment variable `CONCOURSE_ADD_LOCAL_USER` to a string that
   looks like `user:pass`. On Windows, you can do this from a `cmd`
   prompt that is running as Adminstrator with:

   ```
   C:\> setx -m CONCOURSE_ADD_LOCAL_USER "myuser:mypassword"
   ```

   You will be able to log into the Concourse UI with this username and
   password.

2. Same deal, but for `VAULT_ADMIN_USERPASS`, which is a username/password
   you can use for logging into the Vault instance this spins up.

3. Clone this repository into a subdirectory of your *Windows* home
   directory. I put it at `C:\Users\Jon\src\concourse`.

4. Make sure you have the native Windows version of Vagrant installed,
   as well as VirtualBox (I had VirtualBox installed as part of
   installing Docker Toolbox on Windows Home edition).

5. `vagrant up`

## More details

I eventually settled on this after exhausting a few other
possibilities trying to get this run from the Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL):
* Concourse had trouble launching containers for build when trying to
  run this on Docker Toolbox directly.
* Vagrant wouldn't successfully come up if I tried to launch from a
  WSL directory (like my WSL `~`) or if I tried to run the Linux
  version of Vagrant from WSL.

A few notes on the configuration:

* Because I am just using this locally, the shared keys generated by
  `vault init` are stored locally on the box! This is really not how
  Vault is intended to be used, and is arguably not at all secure, but
  I wanted something convenient for local dev and I was already used
  to Vault as a credential manager for Concourse. However, ports are
  forwarded properly so you should be able to `vault login` against
  `http://127.0.0.1:8200` from a WSL bash prompt (yay!).

* Everything should restart if you `vagrant halt` and `vagrant up`,
  although you will need to unseal the vault after boot. You can do
  this via:
  ```
  C:\wherever>vagrant ssh
  vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ /usr/local/bin/vault-unseal.sh
  ```

* You can use the default `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` Concourse URL.
